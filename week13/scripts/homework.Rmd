You have a set of 4 .csv files in data/homework. Each of these files is a timeseries of temperature and light data collected in tide pools in Oregon by Jenn Fields. Your goal is to bring in all 4 files and calculate the mean and standard deviation of both temperature (Temp.C) and light (Intensity.lux) for each tide pool. Use both a for loop and map() functions in your script. (Basically, do it twice). Due Tuesday at 1pm.
